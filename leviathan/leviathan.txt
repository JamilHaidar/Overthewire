# if you do ltrace on a file you can access, you can see we have 3 commands:
# access("test.txt", 4)                                                                                                                            = 0

# system("/bin/cat test.txt"hi 123
# meaning that it first sees if the file exists then creates a string with /bin/cat and the input argument, then runs system on it
# solution is create a file with its name being the command injection. For example, "test.txt; bash"
# the access command works since it exists, the cat will run on a file called test.txt, and then bash will run giving us access to leviathan3
